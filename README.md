This repository contains code to create serachable pdf from scanned pdfs or images. For multi pages pdf, pdfs for individual pages are stored which can be merged as per need.

# Tesseract as OCR engine
I have used Tesseract by Google to perform OCR as it is open sourced and frequently maintained library. For python implementation, there is library called "pytesseract".

For installation steps,[click there]( https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract)

Apart from pytesseract, other important libraries used are,
* PIL
* matplotlib
* wand
* pyPDF2
